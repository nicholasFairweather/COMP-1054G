            <h1>About TrendHive</h1>
            <p>
                Hey there! TrendHive started as a wild idea between two students who were tired of the same old social media experience.  
                We wanted a place where trends weren’t just something you scrolled past—they were something you could <span class="highlight">be a part of</span>.  
                So, we built it.
            </p>

            <p>
                TrendHive is all about what’s happening <strong>right now</strong>.  
                <br>No weird algorithms deciding what you see. No corporate nonsense.  
                <br>Just real people sharing real trends as they happen. Whether it’s music, fashion, memes, or whatever’s popping off, this is the place to catch it first.
            </p>

            <p class="cta">
                So, if you’re ready to ditch the old-school feeds and actually be part of what’s trending,  
                <br><span class="highlight">Welcome to the Hive.</span> Let’s make some waves.  
            </p>

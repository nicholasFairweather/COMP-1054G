                <p>
                    The club isn't the best place to find a <mark id="singlove">lover</mark><br> 
                    So the bar is where I go<br>
                    Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
                    Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br>
                    Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
                    And trust me I'll give it a chance now<br>
                    Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
                    And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like<br>
                    Girl, you know I want your <mark id="singlove">love</mark><br>
                    Your <mark id="singlove">love</mark> was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                    Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    <mark id="love">I'm in love with the shape of you</mark><br>
                    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
                    Although my heart is falling too<br>
                    <mark id="love">I'm in love with your body</mark><br>
                    And last night you were in my room<br>
                    And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
                    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
                    <mark id="love">I'm in love with your body</mark><br>
                    <mark id="brac">(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)</mark><br>
                    <mark id="love">I'm in love with your body</mark><br>
                    <mark id="brac">(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)</mark><br>
                    <mark id="love">I'm in love with your body</mark><br>

                    One week in we let the story begin<br>
                    We're going out on our first date<br>
                    You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
                    Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br>
                    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
                    And how your family is doing okay<br>
                    And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
                    Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like<br>
                    Girl, you know I want your <mark id="singlove">love</mark><br>
                    Your <mark id="singlove">love</mark> was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                    Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    <mark id="love">I'm in love with the shape of you</mark><br>
                    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
